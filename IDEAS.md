# Theme: Roll of the Dice

## Ideas

- Dice rolling game, but you're a psychic and can subtly manipulate the dice
- Some kind of quantum state mechanic, where an action (moving, attacking, etc) has some randomness to it
- Roguelike with random dungeon
- Metroidvania with random / moving rooms / weapons?
  - Randomly changing weapons?
  - Every time you roll, you switch to one of 6 weapons?
  - You get to control loadout?
  - Can extend to defense / phase-ability
- Roguelike where you can "roll" the dice a few times
  - Or even re-arrange while playing the dungeon

## Choice: Metroidvania

- Metroidvania with random weapons
  - Weapon changes upon dodge-roll
  - Weapon imbues you with "color"?
  - You get to control loadout?
  - Can extend to defense / phase-ability

Visual theming: colors / hues?

Weapons:
- Mix of long-range and short range?
- Different colors have different bullet types
  - Also enemies can "shift" between colors and become immune to them

Defense:
- Safe for player? Color imbues defense
- Maybe only certain items in the stage do this
